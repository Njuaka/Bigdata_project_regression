# Predictive Modeling for Music Track Metrics

## ABOUT
    This repository houses a comprehensive analysis of predictive modeling for music 
    track metrics using a dataset containing 518 features from 106,574 tracks, 
    spanning 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums. The primary focus is on two regression 
    tasks: predicting the number of times a track is listened (track_listens) and 
    predicting the release year of a track (album_date_released).


## Project Steps
    1. Data Partitioning
    Employ robust data partitioning techniques, such as cross-validation or repeated 
    splitting, to ensure reliable model validation.

    2. Data Cleaning

    Conduct thorough data cleaning, including outlier detection, handling missing data,
    and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.

    3. Model Comparison

    Evaluate and compare the performance of at least three different prediction models
    for each regression task. Potential models include linear regression, decision 
    trees, and ensemble methods.

    4. Performance Evaluation

    Utilize multiple performance measures tailored to the characteristics of the data 
    and the regression problems. Common metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root 
    Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared can be employed.

    5. Dimensionality Reduction

    Explore three dimensionality reduction mechanisms, considering methods like Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Isomap, and feature selection approaches. Compare the 
    models' performance with the baseline models.

    6. Optional Improvements

    investigate potential enhancements to model performance, such as selecting a subset
     of instances, employing ensemble models, augmenting data, or experimenting with 
     alternative distance measures or loss functions during training.
